HTTP::RangeSaver

This is a helper class for updating an existing file with data from a
partial content HTTP response.  It understands both of the partial content
formats defined in RFC 2616 (a single Content-Range header or a
multipart/byteranges Content-Type).  For convenience, it also handles
complete content HTTP responses (status 200 or 203 rather than 206).


PREREQUISITES

  libwww-perl (version 5.805 or better)


INSTALLATION

The usual four-stroke process:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Testing doesn't require any kind of network connection since it uses
synthetic HTTP::Response objects.
